# Sampling Distributions Dance Party!

### Getting Started [Here](Sampling_distribution.ipynb)

To embark on this journey of learning and dancing, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

#### Python Environment:
Ensure you have a Python environment set up on your computer. If not, you can download and install Python from python.org.

#### Jupyter Notebook: 
We recommend using Jupyter Notebook for a more interactive learning experience. You can install it using pip:

Copy code: pip install notebook

#### Codecademy: 
I'd like to give special credit to Codecademy for providing this project as part of their curriculum. If you haven't already, be sure to explore their courses and resources on data science and machine learning.

#### Project Data:
Download the spotify_data.csv file provided by Codecademy. Ensure it's in the same directory as your Jupyter Notebook or Python script.

Get your dancing shoes ready! You are a DJ trying to make sure you are ready for a big party. You don’t have time to go through all the songs you can work with. Instead, you want to make sure that any sample of 30 songs from your playlist will get the party started. To do this, you will use the power of sampling distributions!
